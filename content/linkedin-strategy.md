# LinkedIn Content Engine

## Positioning
**Dron = AI practitioner who actually ships.** Not a commentator. Someone building in public, sharing real findings from the trenches.

## Content Pillars

### 1. Build In Public (Primary)
What you're actually doing with OpenClaw:
- Trading bots hitting real markets
- Autonomous agents running 24/7
- Command center architecture
- Wins and losses (transparent)

### 2. AI Capability Reports
Real tests and findings:
- Model comparisons (speed, cost, quality)
- Agent autonomy experiments
- Tool integration deep-dives
- What's actually working vs hype

### 3. Market/Community Intel
What other builders are doing:
- Interesting GitHub projects
- Polymarket strategies that work
- X threads worth dissecting
- Tooling trends from Discord/Telegram

### 4. Strategic Takes
Your perspective on where this is going:
- AI employment displacement (you're hiring agents)
- The shift from SaaS to "agents as employees"
- Why most AI implementations fail

## Voice
- Direct, no fluff
- Data-backed when possible
- "Here's what I tried" not "AI will change everything"
- Occasional humor/dark takes

## Post Types

| Type | Frequency | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Build updates | 2x/week | "Just shipped X. Here's what broke" |
| Capability test | 1x/week | "Tested 4 models on Y task. Results:" |
| Community intel | 1x/week | "Saw someone do X. Here's why it matters" |
| Strategic take | 1-2x/week | "Everyone's wrong about Z" |

## Content Calendar (Draft)

**Monday:** Weekend build update
**Wednesday:** Capability test or tool review
**Friday:** Community intel or strategic take

## Current Assets to Mine

From your setup:
- Polymarket weather bot (live trading, real money)
- FastLoop v8 ML pipeline
- X bot growth metrics
- Command center architecture
- OpenClaw multi-agent system

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Create content template library
2. [ ] Set up research pipeline (what to monitor)
3. [ ] Draft first 5 posts
4. [ ] Optional: Automate posting via n8n or similar
