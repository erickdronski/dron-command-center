# 2026-02-23 — Session Summary

## Decisions
- **Prioritize agent_state.json over x_bot_state.json** for social metrics — x_bot_state was stale (0 replies) while agent_state had real data (4 replies, 24 likes)
- **Add shared state writing to weather trader** — bot was only posting to Discord, not updating dashboard data source
- **Keep Kalshi data source as shared state file** — direct API returns stale/wrong data, shared state is ground truth
- **Precision Algorithms X Bot — build mode only** — no API credentials yet, no cron, no automation until Dron provides @PrecisionAlgos keys
- **Browser relay test successful** — can navigate precisionalgorithms.com Admin War Room, screenshot visuals, parse signal data

## State Changes
- kalshi_shared_state.json: **Added 2 weather trades** (manually from Discord history) — $2.85 → $5.07 total spent
- Weather trader script: **Now writes to shared state** on each trade execution
- Status API: **Fixed social data priority** — agent_state.json > x_bot_state.json
- Analytics page: **Removed stale KalshiData interface** — now uses unified status API response
- **#precision-algorithms-x channel model**: Confirmed on grok-4

## Lessons
- Bots posting to Discord ≠ bots updating dashboard data sources — need explicit shared state writes
- Multiple data sources for same metrics (x_bot_state vs agent_state) — need clear priority hierarchy
- File-based data requires discipline — every writer must update shared state, not just post to chat
- Build errors from unused imports (StatusBadge) — need to clean up as we refactor
- **Browser automation for social content**: Can extract Performance tab stats, Live Signals, Events data — but Social Studio graphic generation needs retest (connection dropped)

## Blockers
- **Precision Algorithms X API credentials** — pending from Dron before any live posting
- **Browser relay stability** — connection dropped during Social Studio test, may need retry

## Live Figures (as of commit 6adec6a)
- Kalshi: $5.07 spent, 5 trades (3 price, 2 weather)
- X: 4 replies, 24 likes, $0.34 budget
- Cron: 16 jobs from OpenClaw, 2 with errors

## Precision Algorithms Bot — Discovered Capabilities
**Accessible via browser relay:**
- Performance tab: Win Rate (53.6%), Profitability (-1.6u), Precision (54%), Dog Catcher (41%)
- Live Signals: 12 active signals with team logos, odds, probability %
- Completed signals table: 28 signals with WIN/LOSS results, units
- Events tab: Event cards (e.g., NFL Playoffs 11W/2L, 84.6% win rate)
- "Open in Social Studio" buttons on each signal — likely generates post graphics

**Morning automation potential:**
- Screenshot stat cards → X post with daily performance
- Parse yesterday's wins → Brag post with specific picks
- Event performance → Event recap graphics
