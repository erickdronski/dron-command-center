# 2026-02-22 — Session Summary

## Decisions
- **Paused all cron jobs** — Dron requested everything moved to back burner to stop API credit burn
- **Switched #kalshi channel model to Grok** — moved from Claude Sonnet to xai/grok-4 for this channel
- **Re-enabled Kalshi Price Farmer** — Dron wants 15-min crypto trading live again
- **Fixed cron interval** — changed from 15 min to 2 min to catch 15-min market windows
- **Executed 3 live trades** — XRP YES @ 95¢, BTC YES @ 94¢, XRP YES @ 96¢ (all in 9:15 PM window)
- **Built Kalshi Price Farmer v2 — Elite Edition** — implemented all 5 requested upgrades in one comprehensive rewrite
- **Deployed v2 to production** — switched cron from v1 to v2, tested and live

## State Changes
- Kalshi Price Farmer cron: **UPGRADED TO v2**, 2-min interval, using xai/grok-4-fast
- Balance: $4.38 → $1.53 → $4.49 (fluctuating with portfolio value)
- Portfolio: $21.35 → $23.18
- Daily spend: $2.85/$9.00 (Price Farmer budget tracking active)
- Shared state: Fresh day, $0 → $2.85 spent
- New script created: `kalshi_price_farmer_v2.py` with Kelly sizing, auto-exits, spot signals, order book flow, ML prediction
- **v2 NOW LIVE** — running every 2 minutes, waiting for next 15-min market window

## Lessons
- Cron jobs were burning credits with frequent runs (every 30s, 2min, etc.) and model fallback errors
- Multiple jobs had invalid model references (google/gemini-2.5-flash not allowed) causing silent failures
- 2-minute interval is the sweet spot for catching 15-min market convergence windows
- Bot is profitable — 3/3 trades executed with positive edge (4-6¢)
- Elite features require significant code complexity but provide compounding edge

## Blockers
- Low balance ($4.49) limits position sizing — need auto-deposit or compounding strategy
- ✅ v2 DEPLOYED — running every 2 minutes, waiting for next 15-min market window

## Next Upgrades Discussed
- ✅ Kelly criterion position sizing (edge-based scaling) — IMPLEMENTED in v2
- ✅ Auto take-profit/stop-loss exits — IMPLEMENTED in v2
- ✅ Spot market signals (Binance/Coinbase leading indicators) — IMPLEMENTED in v2
- ✅ Order book flow analysis — IMPLEMENTED in v2
- ✅ ML prediction layer — IMPLEMENTED in v2 (heuristic model with training data logging)
- Auto-compounding reinvestment — pending
- Cross-market correlation risk management — pending
