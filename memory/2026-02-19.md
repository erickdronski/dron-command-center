# 2026-02-19 — Session Log

## Context
First ever session with Dron. He said "yo" and we got straight to work.

---

## What Happened

### Mission Control Rebuild (Major)
- Dron sent a text article about Mission Control + 5 screenshots of "Henry's Mission Control" as inspiration
- Requested full rebuild: Tasks, Content, Calendar, Memory, Team, Office, Live Feed pages
- Specifically wanted: **live dynamic coding feed** so he can watch AI work in real-time
- Gave **full autonomy** over the codebase

**Built via sessions_spawn sub-agent:**
- 8 new pages + sidebar layout + 4 API routes
- Build: 22 routes, 0 TypeScript errors
- Committed + pushed to erickdronski/dron-command-center

### Approved Tasks Executed
Dron showed Approvals page with 2 approved items:
1. **"Add auto-deploy to Vercel on build success"** → GitHub Actions workflow created
2. **"Integrate real-time NOAA weather data for trading"** → `/weather` page with live NOAA API + BUY/WATCH/HOLD signals for 6 cities

### Memory Page Fix
- Root cause: API hardcoded `/Users/dron/...` path — Vercel servers don't have that path
- Fix: switched to `process.cwd()` — now works in any environment
- Memory files were also empty — filled them all out

### Memory Layer Built Out
- `MEMORY.md` — comprehensive long-term memory (Dron profile, all bots, infrastructure, projects, prefs)
- `IDENTITY.md` — filled out (Dron Builder, 🏗️, AI operative)
- `USER.md` — Dron's full profile (Erick Dronski, @DronskiErick, all projects, preferences)
- `memory/2026-02-19.md` — this file

### Analytics Page Added
- New `/analytics` route in sidebar
- Pulls from `/api/status`: P&L 24h, X followers + goal progress, win rate, active bots
- Cron job grid, projects snapshot, 30s auto-refresh

### GitHub CI/CD Pipeline — Fully Wired
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Blocker 1: first GitHub PAT lacked `workflow` scope → Dron provided new classic PAT (stored in git remote URL locally)
- Blocker 2: fine-grained PAT (`github_pat_...`) rejected on push — needed classic PAT instead
- Pushed all 3 GitHub secrets via API (Python + nacl + curl):
  - `VERCEL_TOKEN` = set as GitHub secret (value not stored in repo)
  - `VERCEL_ORG_ID` = `team_yQ5rBCyVa8Z7R3aL3IULvJV0`
  - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` = `prj_zfbXJ9Ir2SlBh5ecuQ73IOMxwZFb`
- First full pipeline run: **success** ✅
- From now on: every push to `main` auto-deploys via GitHub Actions

---

## Decisions Made
- File-based data only (JSON in `public/data/`) — no external DB
- Live feed writable via POST to `/api/live-feed` — AI logs its own work
- Protected files in Memory UI: SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md, HEARTBEAT.md
- Deletable: `memory/*.md` and `MEMORY.md` only
- Claude Code CLI auth was broken (no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in env) — used sessions_spawn instead

## Lessons
- Claude Code CLI requires auth/PTY confirmation — `dangerouslySkipPermissions` in settings.json bypasses warning but still needs trust confirmation per directory
- Fine-grained GitHub PATs (github_pat_) behave differently from classic PATs — for repo write + workflow scope, classic PATs are simpler
- GitHub Actions secrets must be encrypted with repo's public key via nacl before pushing via API
- Hardcoded absolute paths in API routes break Vercel — always use `process.cwd()`

## Infrastructure State (End of Session)
- **GitHub token (classic):** stored in git remote URL locally, not committed
- **Vercel token:** stored as GitHub Actions secret `VERCEL_TOKEN`, not committed
- **Vercel project:** `prj_zfbXJ9Ir2SlBh5ecuQ73IOMxwZFb` / org `team_yQ5rBCyVa8Z7R3aL3IULvJV0`
- **Live site:** https://dron-command-center.vercel.app — fully deployed, all pages working
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions pipeline live, deploys on every push to main

## Open Items
- BOOTSTRAP.md still exists in workspace — should delete
- YouTube short "How AI runs my business" — pending approval in Approvals queue
- Kalshi weather trader (v1-v3) commits exist from prior session — large expansion to 438 markets, 20 cities — worth reviewing
