# 2026-02-19 — Session Log

## Context
First ever session. Dron said "yo" and we got to work immediately.

## What Happened

### Mission Control Rebuild (Major)
- Dron sent 6 files: text article about Mission Control setup + 5 screenshots of Henry's Mission Control (inspiration)
- Goal: rebuild command center to match that style — Tasks, Content, Calendar, Memory, Team, Office, Live Feed pages
- Specifically requested: **live dynamic feed showing me coding in real-time**
- Gave full autonomy over the codebase

- Built all 8 pages via sub-agent (sessions_spawn)
- Build succeeded: 22 routes, 0 TypeScript errors
- Committed and pushed to erickdronski/dron-command-center

### Approved Tasks Executed
Dron showed screenshot of `/approvals` page with 2 approved items:
1. **"Add auto-deploy to Vercel on build success"** → Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` but GitHub token lacks `workflow` scope. Vercel already auto-deploys via GitHub integration anyway.
2. **"Integrate real-time NOAA weather data for trading"** → Built `/weather` page with live NOAA API + BUY/WATCH/HOLD trading signals

### Memory Page Issue
- Memory page showing "No files found" because no memory files existed yet
- Filling out now + upgrading page with delete functionality

## Blockers
- GitHub token: needs `workflow` scope to push `.github/workflows/` files
- SIMMER_API_KEY not confirmed — needed for live weather trading

## Next Steps
- Delete BOOTSTRAP.md (no longer needed)
- Monitor weather page in production
- Watch for Dron to approve/reject content proposals
