# Session Notes — February 27, 2026

## LinkedIn Content Engine (content-automation-hub)

### What Was Built
Full LinkedIn personal brand content system for Dron's AI practitioner positioning.

**Files created:**
- `content/CONTENT-ENGINE.md` — master doc: 4 pillars, 8 templates, 10 ready posts, research pipeline, metrics
- `content/README.md` — quick start guide
- `content/linkedin-strategy.md`, `linkedin-templates.md`, `linkedin-posts-ready.md`
- `content/research.sh` — daily 5-min intel checklist script
- `content/generate-post.sh` — auto-generate post drafts by type (build/results/test/intel/strategic)
- `content/drafts/`, `ready-to-post/`, `posted/` — workflow folders
- `content/VISUAL-ASSETS.md`, `VISUAL-INVENTORY.md`, `SCREENSHOT-GUIDE.md`
- `content/CONTENT-ENGINE.md` — complete system

**Analytics pages built:**
- `app/analytics/trading/page.tsx` — P&L chart, win rate, daily results, recent trades
- `app/analytics/x/page.tsx` — follower growth chart, engagement metrics

### Positioning Decided
Dron = AI practitioner who actually ships. Not commentator. 4 pillars:
1. Build In Public (40%)
2. AI Capability Reports (25%)
3. Community Intel (20%)
4. Strategic Takes (15%)

### Content Direction
- First 3 posts to use: OpenClaw early adopter, Hiring Agents take, Model Testing
- Mon/Wed/Fri posting cadence
- Dark theme screenshots for visuals — `/analytics/trading` and `/analytics/x` are screenshot-ready

## "Overengineered with AI" Series Concept

Dron approved the concept: funny/absurd LinkedIn series showing pointless things built with OpenClaw. Target: business professionals finding it amusing.

### First Build: Caffeine Optimization Engine

**What was built:**
- `scripts/caffeine_bot.py` — full pharmacokinetics model
  - Half-life: 5.7h, sleep threshold: 25mg
  - Caffeine sources: coffee/espresso/cold brew/energy drink/etc.
  - ASCII curve chart, JSON output, saves to `public/data/caffeine.json`
  - CLI: `--wake --sleep --coffees --source --json --notify`
  - Science citation: Statland & Demas, 1980
- `app/caffeine/page.tsx` — full dashboard
  - Big orange cutoff time hero
  - Live SVG caffeine curve (orange=bad, green=safe)
  - Config inputs (wake/sleep/coffees/source)
  - Auto-refreshes every 5min
- `app/api/caffeine/route.ts` — API endpoint
- Added ☕ Caffeine to nav in `layout.tsx`
- Daily 8am EST cron (ID: b05820af) → #precision-algorithms-x with sarcastic briefing

**Deployed:** Pushed to main, Vercel auto-deployed, live at `dron-command-center.vercel.app/caffeine`

**LinkedIn post drafted:** `content/drafts/caffeine-bot-linkedin-post.md`
- Best screenshot: run `--source cold_brew` → shows "Safe to sleep by: 09:17 AM"

## Channel Routing Fix

**Problem:** "X DM Outreach - 1/hour" cron job was delivering to #content-automation-hub (1476024756456263690)
**Fix:** Updated delivery target to #precision-algorithms-x (1475320497490231438)
**Cron ID:** 24f3423d-5bed-4283-80f0-272fd7a10690 ✓ Fixed

## Key Decisions

- LinkedIn content should showcase real systems (trading bot, command center) with specific numbers
- "Overengineered" series = tech is real and impressive, use case is stupid — that's the joke
- Cold brew terminal output ("Safe to sleep by 9am") is the hero screenshot for the caffeine post
- Content channel routing: trading/algo notifications → #precision-algorithms-x, NOT #content-automation-hub

---

## Backlog / Next Steps

- Build more "overengineered" series entries (meeting cost analyzer, buzzword generator, email-or-meeting detector)
- Take actual screenshots of `/caffeine` and `/analytics/trading` for post visuals
- Post the OpenClaw Early Adopter post (ready now, good timing with Axios/Wikipedia coverage)
- LinkedIn profile URL shared: `linkedin.com/in/erickdronski/`
