# Memory — 2026-02-26

## Session Summary

Short session. User greeted ("hello") but no specific task was requested or completed.

---

## Pending Decision (carried from last session)

Dron has not yet decided between:
- **Option A (Fix)**: Auto-sync cron job (local machine) → `scripts/sync-data.sh` + git push hourly → keeps Vercel data fresh
- **Option B (Strip)**: Keep only Value Engineering tab; remove Dashboard, Analytics, Team, Calendar, Posts, Live Feed

**No action taken.** Waiting on this call before any further work.

## Key State (as of Feb 24, last sync)

- `kalshi_shared_state.json`: price_farmer 8 trades today, $8.12 spent
- `dronskierick_bot_state.json`: 4 replies, 9 likes, $0.112 spent
- `x_posts.json`: 12 posts (Feb 18–25)
- `cron_jobs.json`: 17 enabled jobs
- All data stale — no auto-sync in place

---

## Blockers

- Vercel serverless cannot read files outside the project dir
- `public/data/` files stale since Feb 24 with no automated refresh
- Root cause: no local cron job running `sync-data.sh` + `git push`

---

## Notes

- No heartbeats to #command-center channel (user preference, noted twice)
- Latest commit on main: `0869ad9`
