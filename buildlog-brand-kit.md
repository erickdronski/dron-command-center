1. **The Origin Story:**
   "I built 12 side projects in 2024. 
   
   Zero went viral.
   
   Then I realized: I was shipping code but not shipping *content* about the code.
   
   So I built BuildLog.AI — an AI tool that turns your GitHub commits into X threads.
   
   Here's how it works 🧵"

2. **Demo Video:**
   Screen recording of:
   - Connecting GitHub repo

   → Generated 2,847 threads
   → Posted 1,203 times
